# MvsDCProject
This is a non-profitable videogame developed for my Videogame Development class
at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey
## Developed with Unity
Axes are specified for two PS4 controllers. This is a game that is not fully
finished; however, it was presented for a videogame development class.
## Open Source
As this is not a finished project, and not a profitable one either. You can
use it to continue and finish it, if you want to.
